## Data Preperation
  We manipulated the data in a way that will work for all Algor√≠tem
  we used these libaries: 
  1. library('ggplot2') # visualization 
  2. library('ggthemes') # visualization
  3. library('scales') # visualization
  4. library('dplyr') # data manipulation
  5. library('mice') # imputation 
  
  We edited some columns like title, name and family size to get a better understaing of the data:

## Second Try - Random Forest

Our seconed try was with Random Forest, we used a training set of 75% and we used some more columns that improved the scores, we had to address some Null values issues since RF doesn't know how to handle Nulls, we used one tree since we don't have a lot of attributes to address.
